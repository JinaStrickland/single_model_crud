# CRUD app

Time to build your very own super-duper Rails app!

Find something you and your partner have in common to build your app about.  Be creative and have fun with it!

On your command line, youâ€™ll do `rails new {{my cool app name}}`

Helpful commands:

`rails generate model field_name1:type field_name2:type` (model names are singular)
Ex:  `rails g model name:string color:string cost:float`

`rails generate controller CoolThings` (controller names are plural)

If you get full CRUD working, find something to challenge yourself!  Suggestions:

- a related model (what fields will you need to add to your table?  Make a migration! Don't forget your relationships on your models)
- validations
- {{your cool new feature idea here}}
